Tabnine will increase your development velocity with real-time code completions in all the most popular coding languages and IDEs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Whether you call it IntelliSense, intelliCode, autocomplete, AI-assisted code completion, AI-powered code completion, AI copilot, AI code snippets, code suggestion, code prediction, code hinting, or content assist, using Tabnine can massively impact your coding velocity, significantly cutting down your coding time.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Under the hood / Tabnine technology</h4>\n<p>\n    Tabnine is powered by multiple language-specialized machine learning models that were pre-trained from the ground up on code. All of Tabnine’s AI models are trained on open-source code with permissive licenses. Tabnine's AI completions can be run on a developer's laptop, on a server behind your firewall, or in the cloud.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Complete code privacy</h4>\n<p>\n    Your code always remains private.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Tabnine NEVER stores or shares any of your code. Any action that shares your code with the Tabnine servers for the purpose of training team models requires explicit opt-in. Tabnine does not retain any user code beyond the immediate time frame required for training models. Any team model created by Tabnine is only accessible to your team members.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Trained on open-source code with permissive licenses</h4>\n<p>\n    Tabnine only uses open-source code with permissive licenses for our Public Code trained AI model (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause). Whether you’re using Tabnine’s Pro plan or our Starter plan, your code and AI data are NEVER used to train any models other than your own team models.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com//code-privacy?utm_source=ide_marketplace&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=jetbrains_marketplace\">Learn more</a>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Tabnine Pro - whole line, full function, and natural language to code completions</h4>\n<p>\n    You’re in control - As you type, Tabnine Pro serves whole-line, full-function, and even natural language to code completions.
