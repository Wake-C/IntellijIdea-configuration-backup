We’ve got the answer - Check out our <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/faq?utm_source=ide_marketplace&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=jetbrains_marketplace\">FAQ</a> page\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Tabnine Support</h3>\n<p>\n    Having some trouble with installation? Something not working the way you hoped? <strong>Tabnine Support</strong> is always happy to help. Feel free to contact us anytime at <a href=\"mailto:support@tabnine.com\">support@tabnine.com</a>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Tabnine Hub</h3>\n<p>\n    A quick click on <strong>Tabnine</strong> on your IDE status bar takes you directly to your <strong>Tabnine Hub</strong> where you can easily update and manage all your account options and customize your suggestion preferences.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>\n<p>\n    After Tabnine’s installation, navigate to the Tabnine's plugin section (go to -&gt; file -&gt; settings -&gt; plugins) and verify that Tabnine local model is successfully loaded.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will view Tabnine completion dialog, with Tabnine suggestions according to the text you type\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3><strong>Deep Completion</strong></h3>\n<p>\n    Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s code completion goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages\n</p>\n<p>\n    Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example,\n    the return type of <code>app.get_user()</code> is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of <code>app.get_users()</code> is assumed to be a list\n</p>\n<p>\n    Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the Transformers Network Architecture. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways\n    <img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://images.tabnine.com/plugins/intellij/social/pixel.png\">\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Tabnine Indexes your entire project and determines which files to ignore by reading your <code>.gitignore</code>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Tabnine cuts your number of keystrokes in half and eliminates unnecessary typos\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Tabnine works right out of the box ensuring frictionless installation and configuration\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Tabnine offers code completion suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><strong><em>Pro Devs Are Talking About Tabnine:</em></strong></h2>\n<br>\n<p>\n    <img width=\"380\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/master/assets/twitter-ps-39.png\" alt=\"Verlaine J muhungu Tweet\">\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img width=\"380\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/master/assets/twitter-ps-40.png\" alt=\"@TemXc Tweet\">\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img width=\"380\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/master/assets/twitter-ps-1.png\" alt=\"Tom Dohnal Tweet\">\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img width=\"380\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/master/assets/twitter-ps-2.png\" alt=\"Paul Mtali Tweet\">\n</p>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>Communities</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://discord.gg/5GnbDg5Jmg\">Join the Tabnine Discord server</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/tabnine-community/shared_invite/zt-mi5n0v6f-4W0Ap4yAUQXS~nVvxwSoJg\">Join the Tabnine community in Slack</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>Check out our Podcast: Eran and Getify chat about AI</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/blog/eran-and-kyle-podcast-ep1/\">Ep. 1 - How does AI work in general?</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/blog/eran-and-kyle-podcast-ep2/\">Ep. 2 - Is AI going to replace us?</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/blog/eran-and-kyle-podcast-ep3/\">Ep. 3 - One language to rule them all</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/blog/eran-and-kyle-podcast-ep4/\">Ep. 4 - Machine Learning and decision making</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>What do leadres of the Dev Community say about Tabnine</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YG4-l3VaOWc?t=106\">Stefan Mischook - Everyone can code with Tabnine, no matter in which programming language</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10cO9UNsA3Y\">Ania Kubów - Battle of the AI AutoCompletion tools!</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/sS8DWRQ_tao?t=92\">Utsav from \"Engineering with Utsav\" explains why he uses Tabnine all the time</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqz9_foZFWQ\">Adrian Twarog - Using Tabnine to write code Faster</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n    More resources: <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/blog\">Tabnine blog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/academy\">Tabnine Academy</a> <a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/faq\">Questions?
